# EBS-Snapshot-Cost-Optimization

The project aims to optimize cloud storage costs by identifying and deleting stale EBS snapshots in an AWS environment. It will automate the process of detecting snapshots associated with unattached volumes (not in use by any active EC2 instances) and remove them, reducing unnecessary storage expenses while maintaining data efficiency. Additionally, the solution will log all actions taken and provide detailed reports for auditing purposes. The process will be fully automated to ensuring continuous cost optimization without manual intervention.
